# Bitcoin price prediction with Deep RL

The concept of using algorithms to ease the decision making in financial markets is nothing new, in fact the term algorithmic trading was coined back in 90s and numerous firms have been using different technologies to make investment decisions since then. In this work I take bitcoin dataset, I analyse it and then implement two different machine learning solutions to address algorithmic trading, one based on recurrent neural network and the other based on deep reinforcement learning. I simulate the trading process and then compare the result of the two methods. In our experiments, the LSTM provides useful results and generates some profits while the DRL approach loses the money.
